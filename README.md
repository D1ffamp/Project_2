# Rock Paper Scissors
* A rock paper scissors game. 



# The Goal for this Project

    The goal of this project is to provide a simple and fun rock,paper,scissors game. The project was inspired by the  Code Institue and their example projects.

# Live website
A link to the live website can be found [here](https://d1ffamp.github.io/Project_2/).


# Design Choices

## Fonts 
I used [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/ "Google Fonts") to find a text that suited the sleek modern design of the website. The font I chose was [Monserrat](https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Montserrat). I felt this font fitted the simplicity of the site.



## Colours 


The main colours used were: 

* --white in the body.
* --black in the header and footer.




# Features


### Header 
+ The Header located at the top of the page has a contrasting background color which helps itstand out.
+ The title of the game can be seen clearly.

### Scoreboard
+ Both the player and the computer log their scores into the scoreboard.


## Future Features
+ I plan to add a button to reset the score
+ I would include a dropdown menu to select a winning score

## Unfixed Bugs 
+ The results area slightly changes position when cycling through outcomes. 


# Deployment 

After finishing the majority of the project I deployed the site on GitHub using the following steps:

## GitHub Pages
+ Navigate to the repository on GitHub and click 'Settings'.
+ Then select 'Pages' on the side navigation.
+ From the source section drop-down menu, select the 'Main' Branch.
+ Click on the 'Save' button.
+ This is now a live website.
+ Any changes after this point can be done through commits and pushing to GitHub. Once pushed the changes will take a few minutes before becoming live.
